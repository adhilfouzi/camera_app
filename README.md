"A new Flutter project."

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,

## Features

### Image Handling

The application includes functionality for adding images from the gallery and capturing photos using the camera.

### Database - Sqflite

The project uses Sqflite, a lightweight SQLite database plugin for Flutter, for data persistence. This is particularly useful for storing and retrieving data related to the images you capture or select.
